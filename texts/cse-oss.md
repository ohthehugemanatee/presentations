# Serious business 
# <3 Open Source

Campbell Vertesi
Note: My name is Campbell Vertesi. Brief intro:
* Got my start in desktop support, then founded one of the first on-site tech support companies in Canada. 



## More about me
* Went from there into hosting, and from there into web application development and consulting.
* I've been involved in startups for 19 years, in Canada, the US, and Germany. Mostly my focus has been strategic services for large NGOs and non-profits, all in Open Source.
* Today I work with Microsoft, as an engineer lead inside CSE. 

Who here knows what CSE does?
* We're like the MI6 of Microsoft. When one of MS's biggest customers gets stuck on a cutting edge tech problem, CSE comes in like MI6 to get them unstuck. Our people do machine learning, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, massive data and server architecture, blockchain, internet of things. That kind of stuff. Sounds pretty good, right?
* But we only help them if they agree to open source all of our work. 
* So we're making open source contributors out of companies like Audi, Deutsche Telekom, and Allianz. 
WHY?
Let's turn this around. How many of you have brought something to hack on tonight? Ah, there's a big event coming up next week, Think.Make.Start, right? So whow many of you have something to bring to ThinkMakeStart?
And how many of you are considering Open Sourcing it?

Why?
- popularity - it might actually have a life after you
- job prospects
- pride

How many haven't decided yet, or haven't really given it much thought?

How many are definitely going to keep it proprietary?

Why not?
- rights concerns
- fear of criticism
- lose control?


Those are reasonable concerns, and they're the same ones big companies struggle with. So I'm going to show you why Microsoft, and 78% of other Enterprise businesses, are trying to become an open source company... because it's the same reasons that you should be open source from the start.

* the one profit model that requires closed source, is selling licenses. Software licenses were the cash cow of the 90's and early 2000's, but that's a dead end business and MS knows it.
* with open source you engage technical decision makers with your product. When you build a developer community, you are building buy-in with the same market who makes purchase decisions... and vice versa. Marketing supports development, which supports Marketing. 
* the world is running on open source. 80% of the web is run on open source stacks. 99% of email. *** You can maintain compatibility with everything yourself... or you can make a policy choice and let other people handle it.
* architecturally, open source drives you towards separation of concerns... which is a good thing. How many people are likely to contribute to a monolithic password manager, vs a slim React-based frontend? This opens up the possibility of minimizing your proprietary codebase - the part that you *really* have to maintain yourself... and open sourcing the rest.
* The real money today is in platform as a service. It's why Azure is working so hard to beat AWS and GCH... and that requires maximum compatibility with open source. You want people to use your platform in as many ways as possible, in environments you never imagined. Open Source is how you do that.

* I don't have long to talk, here... but here are some examples of things that MS - actually, my group within MS - has done recently. These were only possible because of open source. 

* Nether: serverless configurations that work out of the box for game developers. Think leaderboards, "players near me", that kind of stuff. Running the cheapest way possible, with serverless functions. (Everyone here know what serverless functions are? Amazon Lamda?)
  * https://github.com/MicrosoftDX/nether
* Babylon.js : a complete WebGL toolkit in javascript. 
  * https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js
* Vorlon.js : multi-client JS introspection and debugging, in the browser.
  * https://vorlonjs.com
* Clearly Defined: a framework for managing all the open source projects you depend on, including patches, vulnerabilities, etc.
* Nuclio: OSS serverless platform. It's the fastest one out there, even faster than bare metal. Portable across IoT devices, laptops, servers...
  * https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio
* React Native for Windows - build your application in ReactJS, and compile for windows/xbox
  * https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-windows
* NodeRT - use Windows native functionalities from node.js
  * https://github.com/NodeRT/NodeRT
* Project Fortis - collect social media conversations and postings from the public web, analyze with NLP and build dashboards about it. Used to monitor humanitarian, health, and climate crises in real time
  * https://github.com/CatalystCode/project-fortis
* 3dToolkit: toolkit for building 3D and VR applications that run on the cloud and stream video to low powered/low capability devices.

Now, I'll be honest- it's way easier to build an open source business from ground zero, than it is to convert one of the biggest companies in the world. So there's progress, but it's slow. In some departments, like CSE, sharing is built in from the beginning. For us, a project isn't finished until it's published. For other departments, it's a bigger challenge.  

So, next week Think.Make.Start begins. We think this is a huge opportunity for you guys. There's a lot to build and learn with, and 14 days is a LONG time to do that. You get unlimited access to Azure during this time. Build anything you want. I'm gonna be hacking that week on a automotive safety testing infrastructure that builds 10,000 VMs at once.

CTA: As part of our strategic partnership with UnternehmerTUM in H2 we are supporting the lecture series Think.Make.Start which runs from March 14-27. The 50 students participating will have access to an Azure grant during that time, which we definitely want them to leverage. If they have any question regarding our technology stack or need engineering support or simply want to run an idea by us, the meetup is the perfect place to do this.
