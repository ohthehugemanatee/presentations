CSE makes them contribute

Note: We make open source contributors out of companies like Audi, Deutsche Telekom, and Allianz. 



## WHY?

Why would a huge company contribute to Open Source?
Note: Why would a huge company like Microsoft - or BMW, or Commerzbank - contribute to Open Source?
Why would ANY company?



## Why would you?

Note: 
Turn this around. We're all hackers and founders here.
* How many have **brought something to hack on tonight**? 
* Big event next week **Think.Make.Start**. How many are bringing something?
* **how many of you are considering Open Sourcing it?**


* Adoption
* Collaboration/Networking
* Reputation
* "Give back"
* Get work!
* ...

Note:
Popular reasons to open source.
Not an exhaustive list.
Giving back: stackoverflow, wikipedia, firefox, email... If you're using any of these, you're getting benefits from OSS. Giving back to that same ecosystem which has enabled you, feels good.

* **How many haven't decided yet?**
* **How many are definitely going to keep it proprietary?**



## Why not?


* rights concerns
* fear of criticism
* loss of control
* ...

Note:
* Those are reasonable concerns, and big companies struggle with them too. 



## Why big firms go OSS
Note: 
* I'm going to show you why Microsoft, and 78% of other Enterprise-class businesses, are trying to become open source companies... 
* because they're the same reasons that you should be open source from the start.


* "Free development" (kinda)
* Maximize compatibility and flexibility
* Minimize support surface
* **Free marketing** , engage technical decision makers
* Enabler for **SaaS/PaaS models** (where the $ is)

Note: 
* These are in order of importance - The biggest reason is money.
* Generally a low-risk approach. If you don't build community, you don't lose anything by OSS. You can only gain.
* Policy choice that automatically takes compatibility issues off your hands
* Engage technical decision makers with your product. 
  * When you build a developer community, you are building buy-in with the same market who makes purchase decisions... and vice versa.
  * Marketing <--> Development virtuous cycle
* architecturally, open source drives you towards separation of concerns... which is a good thing. 
  * How many people contribute to a monolith, vs a slim React-based frontend? 
  * Minimize proprietary codebase - the part you *really* have to maintain yourself
* The real money today is in platform as a service. Requires maximum compatibility, flexibility, and developer engagement.


### The PaaS motto:
**Enable people to use the platform in as many ways as possible, in environments you never imagined**



## Please, take our tools!

* **A lot** of great tools on Github (I'll show in a moment)
* Unlimited Azure everything
* No seriously, **unlimited** Azure everything.
