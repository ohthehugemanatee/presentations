## Consulting 101 
### CSE ST XLT Offsite, May 2019

Notes:
* We were asked to present 5 minutes on something we know and care about that could be helpful.
* I see CSE's customer engagement as very similar to the consulting I've done for the last 15 years.
* So, welcome to Consulting 101.



## We are consultants

Notes:
* We bring outside expertise and vision to bear on our customers' behalf.
* How many of us here have technical consulting backgrounds?
* We have especially short projects - mostly about a month - but the shape of the work is the same.
* What are the goals for a good technical consultant?


## We are consultants

* Understand the *real* organizational objectives
* Design a solution, help the customer sell it internally.
* Implement effectively and efficiently
* Leave the customer with a nice package they can sell internally.


### We are consultants
## Understand the *real* organizational objectives

Notes:
* The REAL problem. Not what the customer *thinks* they want!
* What does the organization really need? What will take them to the next level? 
* Could be orthogonal to what the customer expects. Gotta walk a line!
* Note though: you have a duty to keep them from making stupid decisions.


### We are consultants
## Design a solution, help sell it 

Notes:
* design the perfect HOW to get there. Walk the customer through the story.
  * what are the steps? What's the MVP at each stage?
  * paint the picture in a way that is compelling, and clear enough that anyone could implement it. 
  * Write out the solution, *and your thought process to get there.*
  * make it visual whenever possible.


### We are consultants
## Implement effectively and efficiently

Notes:
* Both *effective* and *efficient*.
* Lead a structured sprint
* Arrive prepared to code, with something already to show them
* Crisp sprint standups
* Formal sprint review and presentation at the end


### We are consultants
## Leave the customer with a nice package to sell

Notes:
* Never forget: your customer has stakeholders, too.
* Help the customer sell it internally! Your customer's "success" is your success, so enable it!
* The best possible outcome is their boss saying "wow". Do everything you can to make that happen.


### We are consultants
## Key skills

* Analysis
* Architecture
* Clear communication and high documentation standards
* Time estimation
* Professionalism

Notes:
* One of the most high value things you can do as a consultant is simply to adopt a highly professional attitude. 
* I want to call this out for CSE with a short video.

## We are not consultants

"We're a team of friendly geeks who accelerate developers to build epic stuff"
-- John Shew

Notes:
* All of us with consulting backgrounds have to temper our instinct with some key adjectives:
  * Friendly - people over process!
  * Geek - we focus on engineering communication, not business - short, concise documents. Sparse style.
  * Epic stuff - we target the biggest wins technically and business-wise. We will not be in every sprint! 



## Getting there from here

Notes:
* For 80-100 people to develop new a new skillset will take time.
* Apply a systems approach - look for patterns to give people the desired experience.


### Getting there from here
## From the top down

* set standards, not process
* publicly celebrate great deliverables, behavior, and wins
* offer support "on the scene" 


### Getting there from here
## From the bottom up

* Share deliverable templates based on your experience
* Spread deliverable examples through reviews
* Get one experienced consultant into each engagement
* Take explicit ownership of doc/prep deliverables


### Getting there from here
## Next steps

* Interested? Come talk to me!
* Got example docs? Send them to me!
* Help spread the word: *high standards reap great rewards*



## Thank you!
