# Welcome
#### Our Goal: to hear from YOU where we should invest and improve. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

* Goal: to hear from YOU where we should invest and improve. 
* this is a goal we really believe in: this is a big time block with a lot of people, disturbing a lot of projects. That's a big investment, so let's make sure it's worth it!


# Ground Rules

* Raise the roof!<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* No recordings, anonymous feedback<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Be brutally honest<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* RETRO ALL THE THINGS<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

* In order for this to work, we will need a couple of ground rules
  * Applause.
    * Avoids unnecessary disruption and it signals your support for an idea.
    * let's practice now! I'll say something you can agree with: "I need a break from re-orgs"
  * Use the "raise hand" feature steadily if you have a question or a comment to insert.
* This call will not be recorded, the only things we are taking away are the explicit "takeaways" we agree on at the end of each exercise.
  * All the feedback tools we're using are anonymous
* Your honesty and candor are critically important. 
* we all understand that things can be addressed and improved on different levels - some in your crew, some in your geo, your industry, or maybe they need CSE all-up leadership. 
  * please let the LT deal with that. 
  * You'd be surprised how much latitude we have as an industry, and how much influence we can have on CSE all-up


# Agenda

* Warm up
* Team Radar
* Good/NotGood/Actions
* Appreciations

Notes:

* We'll have a short break between each activity.
* Warm Up: just what it sounds like
* Team Radar:
  * everyone rates how it is in Automtive on a bunch of different scales that we care about in LT
  * we can all see the results, get a sense of how we're doing as a team
* exercise 3: typical scrum style retro
  * I like to frame the questions a bit differently, though:
    * What makes my life easier/better?
    * What makes my life harder/worse?
    * How could we make it better?
* exercise 4: Appreciations
  * shout out to your colleagues who you think have done something cool, fun, or generally great this Half.


# Let's go!



# Next Steps

* LT will announce actions<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* We'll retro again<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Rinse and repeat<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

* The Automotive LT will discuss this feedback and come back next week with actions we can take for next Half.
* Then we'll retro again, to see what helped


# Thank you!

Notes:

* Thanks to Beat and Judy for their trust and good ears in the process
* Thank you to all of YOU! This is incredibly valuable feedback.
* Next year we will do even better!
