## CSE Innovation Network
### January 2019

Notes:
* Welcome to the all-hands.
* I'm Campbell Vertesi, an app plat manager out of Berlin, Germany.


## Agenda

* WTF is this, anyway?
* How to change something at CSE.
* What are we already trying? How can I help?
* Open discussion: ideas for change.

Notes:
* Your time and brainpower are valuable, so I won't waste them.
* This meeting is repeated 3x, in each timezone block. We will post the recording, too.
* I don't stand on ceremony. Please interrupt me with questions at any time. Do not pull punches.
* Here's our agenda for today. 



## WTF is this, anyway? 

**The Tech Domain communities connect everyone at CSE**, communicating good engineering practice and gaining the insight that can only come from a diverse perspective. They are where "One Global CSE" happens.

**We can create "unstoppable" domain communities to supercharge SE's technical growth**. They would **shorten the feedback loop** to helping customers and improving Azure, and **power massive impact in the S400**. If we fail to do this, **Amazon will eat our enterprise lunch**.

Notes:
* This is the group who wants to seize that opportunity.
* Unstoppable tech domain communities would be a great benefit for CSE and Microsoft. 
* We are the people will make it happen!


## Innovation Network

Notes:
* An innovation network is a specific kind of agile business practice.
* NB: I don't mean "agile" as in the development methodology; I mean it as in "fast moving and changing." It has a particular meaning in the business world.
* The idea is that you get the broadest possible cross-section of people together in a room, up and down the hierarchy and across all subdivisions. And you have THEM come up with ideas for improvements.
* The group has to align closely with the organizational goals, it has to prioritize tasks based on what will produce the biggest wins, and it has to be close to the ground. 
* This is CSE's innovation network.


## Our network

* Every Region
* Every Tech Domain
* Every level band
* Both ICs and Managers
* Every CSE sub-unit

Notes:
* Happy that just by putting out the information, we got a perfect list of 53 members. 
* Every level from SE2 to Principal
* Every CSE unit: ST, Industry, ART, DevCrews, EEST


## Structure

* Innovation community
  * Comes up with, refines, and implements ideas.
* Governing Committee
  * Maintains contact with experiments
  * Maintains contact with appropriate LTs
  * Makes sure experiments are aligned with CSE/TD goals



## OMG not another meeting

Notes:
* This is not a place where we talk about things endlessly. 
* A subset of the group will have about one meeting a month. 
* For everyone else, no meetings a month.


## No one gives permission

Note:
* This is a part of the reason we don't need frequent meetings.
* Don't expect to receive marching orders here. 
* Don't wait for permission. Just bring your idea up, refine it in discussion, and go. 
* Occasionally there may be an idea where we ask you to slow down and let's talk it through to check alignment. But in this group, that's the exception.


## Everyone is equal

Note:
* This is a discussion group. There are no formal roles or titles.
* Please do not treat managers or senior levels any differently - we're all just humans trying to improve this thing we do.
* In some Innovation Networks, people as high as VPs will join. They have to get used to this feeling. Fortunately the managers we have are all relatively relaxed anyway.


## How is this going to help anything?

We help each other:
* Ideate improvements
* Make improvements happen
* Spread successful improvements
* Turn successful improvements into formal process.



##  How to change something at CSE
### (How the innovation network works)

* Discuss/refine an idea in channel
* Start doing it in a small, localized experiment
* Iterate
* ~~Profit~~ Spread the working result to other domains.

Notes:
The process itself is simple.
* do it WITH some colleagues in your experiment. Maybe from here!
* Enter your experiment into the spreadsheet, and keep your GC posted about it. They will ping you about it if you don't reach out to them!
* If an idea works, we try to spread it to other Tech Domains.
* The GC communicates with Leadership about working ideas being spread, so the LT and formalize and support them.


## Anyone can start an Experiment

Note:
* You only need an idea, and a Domain where you'll try it first. 
* The General channel is a great place to hash out your idea and find some people to help


## Anyone can help make an Experiment happen

Note:
* Just reach out to the Prime Mover and offer your help!


## Anyone can join the Governing Committee

* 12-ish person, diverse subset of the group
* Follows up on, supports, and communicates about experiments.
* Makes sure we stay aligned with our Opportunity and the CSE mission.

Note:
* We have 14 people signed up to be the first governing committee, so that's perfect
* Each Region will schedule a separate monthly meeting to review the experiments in their Region. 
* If possible, I will attend to help!
* Membership will rotate on a regular basis, but I don't know how often, yet.


## GC Goals

* Guide new ideas from the community into running experiments.
* Validate that Experiments are in line with our opportunity statement and the CSE vision.
* Follow up on Experiments regularly, and offer help when possible.
* Guide "adopted" experiments to take root in other tech domains
* Celebrate wins.
* Connect with ST Leadership to maintain alignment.

Notes:
* Our first global GC!
Daniel Heinze, Smita Vemulapalli, Reenu Saluja, Andreas Heumaier, Munish Malhotra, Michael Collier, Katia Gil Guzman, Alessandro Vozza, Jit Ghosh, Krit Kamtuo, Regan Murphy, Lace Lofranco, My Ho


## Celebrate and adopt successes

Note:
* One of the most important jobs for the GC is to acknowledge and spread successes around CSE. 
Successful experiments are "adopted" to the other appropriate Tech Domains.ie communicated to the appropriate LT and spread to other Tech Domains.
* The more people see our changes out there, the more they see that we CAN improve things, the more people will want to be involved.
