Notes:
* Getting there was painful, but we've heard a lot of positive feedback.
* Really valuable session with EEST and the global domain teams
* Lots of encouragement from the top to break down the silos and just get it done.
* ongoing push towards "one global team" approach. 
* and we all got one solid engagement in.
* I'm almost over the jet lag.


### How was it for you?

Notes:
* How was OneWeek for you?
  * 3 things that were great
  * 3 things that we should do differently next time
  * 3 things that surprised you



## Remember our goals!

<i class="fas fa-wrench"></i> Build great tech

<i class="far fa-comments"></i> Share great tech

<i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i> Help improve our tech

Notes:
* One of the tricky parts of our job, is that everyone else thinks they're our only priority. 
* We hear it from EEST, we hear it from every industry project, and from DWR.
* So we have to have a really strong idea of what we're doing. 
* Remember: we have several priorities!
* Hint: the cheat sheet for this is in your core priorities document. I'll email it out again later today.
* These priorities are constant. You can ignore the org chart, ignore everything else around you - they're all secondary to these three priorities.


### <i class="fas fa-wrench"></i> Build great tech

Notes:
* What other parts of CSE are involved here?
(Industry teams. AEMs/Openhacks. Strategic Hacks.)


### <i class="far fa-comments"></i> Share great tech

Notes:
* What other parts of CSE are involved here?
(Tech Domains. Reach out to Industry SEs and get them involved)


### <i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i> Help improve our tech

Notes:
* What other parts of CSE are involved here?
(EEST)


### Work is work

Notes:
* everyone thinks they're our only priority. But for us, Work is Work. We don't differentiate.
* Our job is to hit all three of our objectives


<i class="fas fa-wrench"></i> Build great tech

<i class="far fa-comments"></i> Share great tech

<i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i> Help improve our tech

Notes:
* Ideally you're making contributions in all three of these areas.
* They have equal priority!
* A great way to make sure you hit all three: when you schedule an engagement, put time in VSTS in advance to do prep, hack, and feedback.



## First quarter

Notes:
* It’s been a very successful quarter! 
* Developed a rhythm
* got a process in place
* some domain communities really got started
* started delivering good feedback - especially in monthly review meetings.
* A good start on our priorities. Now it's time to double down.


### Leading the charge

Notes:
* There are some people in particular who we'd like to call out for really leading the charge here.
* This isn't a complete list by any means - lots of people have helped to make this a good quarter. But here are some of the people who have done exceptional work on parts of those three big priorities.

## Next steps

### Our ideas to push "one big team" further

Notes:
* So where do we go? It's time to double down on those three priorities
* We're going to focus on the "one big team" approach, breaking down the silos


your domain activities are key! Domain leads will start reaching out to ask you to start conversations, hold calls, and share your work
we will start working with SEIs as collaborators on their engagements, instead of just "resources". Encourage them to come to us early, so we can help them make an engagement that makes sense. (walk through AETHER, process, make sure it's really "CSE Work")
It means a lot of projects won’t get past ADS. We’ll figure out they aren’t CSE work, can’t get the TEA signed, etc. That’s OK!
It means you’ll have multiple projects “on the go” at the same time. That’s OK, too!
Quality and not quantity
We need FORWARD planning in VSTS
work closely with dev crews to make our processes as similar as possible (within reason). 
we're starting to think of engagements in terms of their technologies, rather than their domain. So if you know data bricks, you can join a hack even though data isn't your primary domain.
we're starting to think of SE/Is as available resources, too. One global organization means the right people work on projects, regardless of their org silos.
remember: process is contextual. If you think of a way to hit at our priorities or objectives, Just Do It.
AMA (Ask Me Anything) session. Put the priorities slide up again.
Anticipated questions
MCS using us as free hours!
We have to be careful here. They can be a source of real engagements! But often they don’t know how to ask us. We think collaborating closely between SEI and SET means we can help craft engagements that do make sense.
Is there a reorg coming? What'll it be like? Are we going to work for EEST?
After John's talk about the need to balance headcounts between dev crews and CTE, we expect to see some of that happen.
The answer to most other rumors will be "I don't expect that," and "it will be formally communicated as soon as the details are hammered out. Our LT likes to move quickly once something is decided."
Remember: this is an agile organization. This means the org chart is just a suggestion. Look for opportunities and GO DO IT. 
Are we reporting to EEST?
no one is talking about putting us under EEST.
Can we travel again?
Yes, the budget issue is behind us now. We can travel with good business reason.
Is "tech domain X" going away?
No. We are looking at redefining some of the technical domains  to match the categories of work we see, but that doesn't mean you have to stop working on a field. Remember: Tech Domains are about categorizing our feedback for EEST. It doesn’t limit what you’re interested in, it doesn’t limit you!
We don't have any work!
Actually, we have lots of work, and the pipeline is growing. About 8 triage requests per week! And there’s even more work globally. It may still seem slow since many projects are stuck waiting for TEA or schedules to align... but all signs point to a busy future.
If there isn’t a lot going on in your area, consider getting involved and learning in a more active area.
