Notes:
* Getting there was painful, but we've heard a lot of positive feedback.
* Really valuable session with EEST and the global domain teams
* Lots of encouragement from the top to break down the silos and just get it done.
* ongoing push towards "one global team" approach. 
* and we all got one solid engagement in.
* I'm almost over the jet lag.


### How was it for you?

Notes:
* How was OneWeek for you?
  * 3 things that were great
  * 3 things that we should do differently next time
  * 3 things that surprised you



## Remember our goals!

<i class="fas fa-wrench"></i> Build great tech

<i class="far fa-comments"></i> Share great tech

<i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i> Help improve our tech

Notes:
* One of the tricky parts of our job, is that everyone else thinks they're our only priority. 
* We hear it from EEST, we hear it from every industry project, and from DWR.
* So we have to have a really strong idea of what we're doing. 
* Remember: we have several priorities!
* Hint: the cheat sheet for this is in your core priorities document. I'll email it out again later today.
* These priorities are constant. You can ignore the org chart, ignore everything else around you - they're all secondary to these three priorities.


### <i class="fas fa-wrench"></i> Build great tech

Notes:
* What other parts of CSE are involved here?
(Industry teams. AEMs/Openhacks. Strategic Hacks.)


### <i class="far fa-comments"></i> Share great tech

Notes:
* What other parts of CSE are involved here?
(Tech Domains. Reach out to Industry SEs and get them involved)


### <i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i> Help improve our tech

Notes:
* What other parts of CSE are involved here?
(EEST)


### Work is work

Notes:
* everyone thinks they're our only priority. But for us, Work is Work. We don't differentiate.
* Our job is to hit all three of our objectives


<i class="fas fa-wrench"></i> Build great tech

<i class="far fa-comments"></i> Share great tech

<i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i> Help improve our tech

Notes:
* Ideally you're making contributions in all three of these areas.
* They have equal priority!
* A great way to make sure you hit all three: when you schedule an engagement, put time in VSTS in advance to do prep, hack, and feedback.



## First quarter

Notes:
* It’s been a very successful quarter! 
* Developed a rhythm
* got a process in place
* some domain communities really got started
* started delivering good feedback - especially in monthly review meetings.
* A good start on our priorities. Now it's time to double down.


### Leading the charge

Notes:
* There are some people in particular who we'd like to call out for really leading the charge here.
* This isn't a complete list by any means - lots of people have helped to make this a good quarter. But here are some of the people who have done exceptional work on parts of those three big priorities.

## Next steps

### Pushing "one big team" further

Notes:
* So where do we go? It's time to double down on those three priorities
* We're going to focus on the "one big team" approach, breaking down the silos


### Breaking down the silos

* Tech Domain outreach
* Collaborate early with SE/Is
* Skills-based resourcing
* People over process


### Tech Domain Outreach

* Domain leads will start prompting more directly for activities, conversation, presentations
* Try to produce one good call (minimum) for each engagement
* Invite SE/Is explicitly

Notes:
* Your domain activities are key!
* Domain leads will start reaching out to ask you to start conversations, hold calls, and share your work
* Lots of SE/Is don't know that we want them involved. Reach out to people you know and invite them


### Collaborate early with SE/Is

* We are collaborators, not an obstacle
* Get in early, help *define* great engagements
* Help get non-CSE work off to the right catchers

Notes:
* we will start working with SEIs as collaborators on their engagements, instead of just "resources". 
* Encourage them to come to us early, so we can help them make an engagement that makes sense.
  * walk through AETHER, process, make sure it's really "CSE Work"
* Means a lot of projects won’t get past ADS. We’ll figure out they aren’t CSE work, can’t get the TEA signed, etc. That’s OK!
* It means you’ll have multiple projects “on the go” at the same time. That’s OK, too!


### Quality and not quantity

Notes:
* Tricky to plan! 
* Relies on our flexibility. That means:
  * good use of VSTS (forward planning! Copious notes!)
  * close partnerships with industry and dev crews.


### Skills-based resourcing
* Think of engagements by their technologies, instead of domains
* SE/Is are SEs, too!
* Get the right people on projects, regardless of org chart

Notes:
* One problem we've had, is that people only "tune in" to projects when they're in the right tech domain.
* hard for cross-cutting domains like data and devOps.
* starting to talk about projects by their technologies. So if you know data bricks, you can join a hack even though data isn't your primary domain.
* Domain tags happen AFTER we've figured out the technologies... and one project can have multiple domains.
* Think of SE/Is as available resources, too.


### People over process
* *People* and *human connections* get things done
* Just Do It
* Seriously, do it
* If it hits at our priorities or objectives, JUST FREAKIN DO IT ALREADY

Notes:
* Processes are just tools. They're important, they're helpful - but it's people and human connections that get things done.
* If you think of a way to hit at our priorities or objectives, Just Do It. You have permission.
* It is your responsibility to find great opportunities and jump on them!
  * We've provided some great tools to help you find those opportunities:
    * project triage meeting
    * EMEA coordination Team
    * Engagement channel
    * VSTS search
    * Teams channels. Ask around!
* **It's your responsibility** to find great tasks that hit at our three priorities.


### Ask Us Anything

<i class="fas fa-wrench"></i> Build great tech

<i class="far fa-comments"></i> Share great tech

<i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i> Help improve our tech

Notes:
MCS using us as free hours!
* We have to be careful here. They can be a source of real engagements! But often they don’t know how to ask us. We think collaborating closely between SEI and SET means we can help craft engagements that do make sense.

Is there a reorg coming?
* After John's talk about the need to balance headcounts between dev crews and CTE, we expect to see some of that happen.
The answer to most other rumors will be "I don't expect that," and "it will be formally communicated as soon as the details are hammered out. Our LT likes to move quickly once something is decided."
Remember: this is an agile organization. This means **the org chart is just a suggestion**. Look for opportunities and GO DO IT. 

Are we reporting to EEST?
* no one is talking about putting us under EEST.

Can we travel again?
* Yes, the budget issue is behind us now. We can travel with good business reason.

Is "tech domain X" going away?
* No. We are looking at redefining some of the technical domains  to match the categories of work we see, but that doesn't mean you have to stop working on a field. **Tech Domains are about categorizing our feedback for EEST**. It doesn’t limit what you’re interested in, it doesn’t limit you!

We don't have any work!
We have lots of work, and the pipeline is growing. About 8 triage requests per week! And there’s even more work globally. It may still seem slow since many projects are stuck waiting for TEA or schedules to align... but all signs point to a busy future.
**If there isn’t a lot going on in your area, consider getting involved and learning in a more active area.**
