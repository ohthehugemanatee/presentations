# Sweet Partner Mine


Where it began 

I can't begin to knowin' 

But now I know we're going strong 


Was in Q1, 

And it became the year end 

Who'd have believed you'd come along 


Plans, Partner Plans 

P-B-P, T-E-P 

Build with me! 


Sweet Partner Mine 

Good times never seemed so good 


I've been inclined 

To believe they never would 

But look at…  


Envisioning 

Dreaming big dreams together 

Apps and Infra is for you 


Transactable? 

We’ll help you Marketplace it! 

No matter how hard, we'll see it through


Plans, Partner Plans 

P-B-P, T-E-P 

Build with you! 


Sweet Partner Mine 

Good times never seemed so good 


I've been inclined 

To believe they never would 

Oh, no, no...


(Dance break!)


Sweet Partner Mine 

Good times never seemed so good 

Sweet Partner Mine 

I believe they never could 



## That's the GPS Way


We’ll take you higher 

Be your multiplier 


Believe when we say 

That’s the GPS way 


Though we’ve our separate

road maps 

We’ll work to 

close gaps 


And we say 

That’s the GPS way 


Tell me why 

Should partners be so separate 


Tell me why 

Should partners not co-operate 


Tell me why 

We win when we collaborate 


That’s the GPS way 


Take part-ners higher 

The mult-iplier 


Yes, we’ll co-operate 

That’s the GPS way 


Tell me why 

Should partners be so separate 


Tell me why 

Should partners not co-operate 


Tell me why 

We win when we collaborate 


That’s the GPS way 


Now we can say that we’ve learned from the past 

From the way that it used to be, yeah 


Because you're my partner I want you to know 

That together we'll claim victory


To take you higher 

Be your multiplier 

We are (we are, we are, we are) 


(Now in other languages!)


(In German!)  

Tell me why 

Sollen Partner so getrennt sein 

Tell me why  

Partner sollen mitarbeiten 


Tell me why  

Wir gewinnen nur zusammen 


That’s the GPS way 


(In French!) 

Tell me why  

Partenaires sont si séparés? 

Tell me why  

Partenaires coopèrent jamais 


Tell me why  

On ne gagne que ensemble 


That’s the GPS way 


(Phone lights on!)

Tell me why 

Should partners be so separate 


Tell me why 

Should partners not co-operate 


Tell me why 

We win when we collaborate 


That’s the GPS way
